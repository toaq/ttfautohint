Compilation and Installation
============================

Please read the files
[`INSTALL`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob_plain;f=doc/INSTALL;hb=HEAD)
and
[`INSTALL.git`](https://repo.or.cz/w/ttfautohint.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/INSTALL.git)
(both part of the source code bundle) for instructions how to compile the
ttfautohint library together with its front-ends using a POSIX compatible
shell and compiler.


Unix-like Platforms
-------------------

The generic instructions should work just fine.  Since ttfautohint depends
on [Qt] version\ 4 or newer, [FreeType] version 2.4.5 or newer, and
[HarfBuzz] version 1.3.0 or newer, you should install packages for these
libraries (called 'libqt4' or similar, 'libfreetype6'^[The number\ '6'
indicates the version of the shared library of FreeType, which is not
directly related to the source code version of FreeType.], and
'libharfbuzz0' or similar) together with its development bundles (called
'libqt4-devel', 'freetype2-devel', and 'harfbuzz-devel' or similar) before
running ttfautohint's `configure` script.


MS Windows
----------

Precompiled binaries `ttfautohint.exe` and `ttfautohintGUI.exe` are
available, being statically linked to [Qt], [FreeType], and [HarfBuzz].
This means that the two programs are not dependent on any other
program-specific DLL, and you can move them to any place you like.

Hints for compilation with the [MinGW] environment are given in
`INSTALL.git`.


Mac OS X
--------

Right now, only a precompiled binary `ttfautohint` is offered; a
ready-to-run app bundle for the GUI version is not yet available; however,
ttfautohint is part of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), making compilation and
installation very simple.

Detailed instructions to compile both `ttfautohint` and `ttfautohintGUI` can
be found on [ttfautohint's
homepage](https://freetype.org/ttfautohint/osx.html).

Character Ranges
================

For the FreeType auto-hinter (and thus ttfautohint), a 'non-base character'
is something that should not be affected by blue zones, regardless of
whether this is a spacing or no-spacing glyph.
